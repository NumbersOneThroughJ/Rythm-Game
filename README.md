# Rythm-Game
 Simple Rythm Game Test concept

Currently has a button, score tracker, and sound playing.
You press consume when you want to play a beat. Depending on how close it is to the center piece, you will get a score.
It showcases how well you did depending on how far away from the beat you were. The score is tracked in the top left.
The number on the right indicates how long until the next beat to spawn at the bottom.

Was just a proof of concept. Going further I'm going to make a tool to make levels for this rythm game so I can easily add in more songs and beats.
